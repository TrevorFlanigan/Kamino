# Graphs and Path-Finding 

This project was completed as apart of CPEN 221: Principles of Software Construction in November 2019.

Following the guidelines of the graph abstract data-type, an implementation of a graph was created with support for basic
operations such as removing and adding nodes and edges to a graph, finding the shortest-path between two nodes and determining
pathways one could take to end up at a specific node given a start location.

Using this implementation, a Spaceship Game can be launched allowing for the user to watch a spaceship travel through a graph 
of planets and edges.  The goal of this spaceship is to reach the planet Kamino, using a limited amount of fuel, and return to 
Earth stopping at differenet planets on the way back collecting spice at each unvisited planet they spaceship passes.  

This goal was limited by how much fuel the spaceship held and also limited information the spaceship had access too.
